Games
Roll
The roll game generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a single die. The result is printed to the console.

Flip
The flip game simulates a coin flip and prints the result to the console. The outcome is randomly selected from "heads" or "tails".

Betroll
The betroll game is similar to roll, but allows you to place a bet on the outcome. If you win, your bet is doubled and returned to you.

Betflip
The betflip game is similar to flip, but allows you to place a bet on the outcome. If you win, your bet is doubled and returned to you.
